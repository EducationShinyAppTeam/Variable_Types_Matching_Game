Chapter: Data Gathering
Description: Identify variable types by nature of measurement [Quantitative (numeric) discrete variables, Quantitative continuous variables, Qualitative (categorical) nominal variables, and Qualitative ordinal variables] and by role in the analysis [explanatory versus response versus confounding].
LearningObjectives: c(
    "The student will learn to identify variable types by nature of measurement",
    "The student will learn to identify variables by their role in analysis."
