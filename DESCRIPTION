Chapter: Data Gathering
Description: Identify variable types by nature of measurement (quantitative (numeric) discrete, quantitative continuous, qualitative (categorical) nominal, and qualitative ordinal variables) and by role in the analysis (explanatory, response, and confounding).
LearningObjectives: c(
    "The student will learn to identify variable types by nature of measurement",
    "The student will learn to identify variables by their role in analysis."
